//! A Markdown scanner for live-styled editing.
//!
//! # What this is for
//!
//! A note is always shown as source and always styled. The syntax characters
//! are hidden everywhere except in the construct holding the caret, which is
//! one `GtkTextView` throughout — not two widgets swapped — so the cursor lands
//! where you clicked and the scroll position never jumps. The view achieves it
//! by applying tags for style and marking the syntax characters with a tag
//! whose `invisible` property is removed from the markers the caret is inside.
//! Reading mode is the same view with nothing revealed at all.
//!
//! So this scanner has an unusual requirement: as well as *what* is styled, it
//! must report exactly **which characters are syntax**, so they can be hidden.
//! A general Markdown library reports the former and not the latter, which is
//! why this exists rather than `pulldown-cmark`.
//!
//! # No renderer
//!
//! Nothing here draws. This is `&str` in, spans and markers out, with no
//! dependencies at all — because the apps that use it draw differently on
//! purpose. Stickies reveals every marker when a note takes focus, Brain
//! reveals only the construct under the caret and re-scans one line per
//! keystroke, and Familiar never reveals any of them and lifts tables out into
//! real grids. One scanner, three policies.
//!
//! # Offsets
//!
//! Everything is in **character** offsets, because that is what
//! `GtkTextBuffer::iter_at_offset` takes. Byte offsets would silently corrupt
//! any note containing an accent or an emoji.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! A subset of CommonMark plus the notebook syntax: wikilinks, embeds, tags,
//! task checkboxes and pipe tables. Not in it: reference links, nested
//! emphasis, setext headings, HTML. Anything unrecognised is left as plain text
//! rather than half-styled, because half-typed formatting is the normal state
//! while writing and must never swallow the rest of the note.
//!
//! # Lines
//!
//! Scanning is line-based, and inline styling therefore does not cross a line
//! break. That is a deliberate trade: it is what makes [`scan_line`] — re-scan
//! exactly one line on a keystroke — possible, and the editor wraps rather than
//! hard-wraps, so emphasis spanning a newline is rare in practice.
